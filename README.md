# ðŸŽ¯ Candidate Dropout Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a candidate will drop out before the final interview â€” helping recruiters reduce pipeline friction and improve hiring outcomes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Final interview "no-shows" waste recruiter time and slow down hiring. This project aims to predict dropout risk early using candidate profile & behavior features.

---

## ðŸ§  Highlights
- Built with **Logistic Regression** (interpretable, fast)
- Covers all modeling assumptions: multicollinearity, log-odds, class imbalance
- 100% **recall** for dropouts via threshold tuning
- Fully deployed with **Streamlit**
- Accepts both single profile inputs & **CSV batch uploads**
- Dashboard with **feature importance** & **ROC curve**
